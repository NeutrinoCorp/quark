# :zap: Quark [![GoDoc][doc-img]][doc] [![Build Status][ci-img]][ci] [![Coverage Status][cov-img]][cov] [![Go Version][go-img]][go]
Reliable Event-Driven mechanisms for reactive ecosystems written in Go using Apache Kafka and/or AWS SNS/SQS.

Based on reliable mechanisms from companies such as [Uber](https://eng.uber.com/reliable-reprocessing/) who serve 1M+ requests per-hour, 
Quark offers a fine-tuned set of tools to ease overall complexity.

In Addition, `Quark` _fans-out processes per-consumer to_ **parallelize blocking I/O** _tasks_ (as consuming from a queue/topic would be) and isolate them. Thread-safe and graceful shutdown are a very important part of Quark.

Furthermore, `Quark` stores specific data _(e.g. event id, correlation id, span context, etc)_ into messages headers in binary format to ease disk consumption on the infrastructure and it lets users use their own encoding preferred library. _(JSON, Apache Avro, etc.)_

Therefore, `Quark` lets developers take advantage of those mechanisms with its default configuration and a `gorilla/mux`-like router/mux to keep them in ease and get befenits without complex configurations and handling. You can either choose use _global configurations_ specified in the broker or use an _specific configuration_ for an specific consumer.

_We will be adding more implementations such as RabbitMQ and NATS in a near future._

## Installation

`go get github.com/neutrinocorp/quark`

Note that quark only supports the two most recent minor versions of Go.

## Quick Start

Before we set up our consumers, we must define our `Broker` and its required configuration to work as desired.

The following example demostrates how to set up an _Apache Kafka_ `Broker` with an error handler (hook).

_When using Apache Kafka, `sarama` package is required as we rely on its mechanisms._

```go
// Create broker
b := quark.NewKafkaBroker(newSaramaCfg(), "localhost:9092")

b.ErrorHandler = func(ctx context.Context, err error) {
  log.Print(err)
}
```

Quark is very straight foward as is based on the `net/http` and `gorilla/mux` packages.
This example demostrates how to listen to an asynchronous topic using the `Topic` function.

If no pool-size was specified, `Quark` will set it to 5 `workers` per-consumer node.

```go
b.Topic("chat.1").HandleFunc(func(w quark.EventWriter, e *quark.Event) bool {
  log.Print(e.Topic, e.RawValue)
  // publish messages to given topics
  _, _ = w.Write(e.Context, e.RawValue, "chat.2", "chat.3") // returns how many messages were published
  return true // this indicates if the consumer should mark the message or not (Ack or NAck)
})
```

Quark parallelize consumers tasks into a pool of `workers` using goroutines and executes graceful shutdown by default. 

The pool size could be defined by the user with a single attribute.

```go
b.Topic("chat.1").PoolSize(10).HandleFunc(func(w quark.EventWriter, e *quark.Event) bool {
  log.Print(e.Topic, e.RawValue)
  // publish messages to given topics
  _, _ = w.Write(e.Context, e.RawValue, "chat.2", "chat.3")
  return true
})
```

Quark is based on _reliable mechanisms_. To make use of them, you just need to set it on either the `Broker` or in an specific topic.

This method relies on `defaultEventWriter` as it contains the preconfigured reliable mechanisms to avoid message loops and many more things.

```go
b.Topic("chat.1").MaxRetries(3).RetryBackoff(time.Second*3).HandleFunc(func(w quark.EventWriter, e *quark.Event) bool {
  log.Print(e.Topic, e.RawValue)
  // publish messages to given topics
  _, _ = w.Write(e.Context, e.RawValue, "chat.2", "chat.3")
  return true
})
```

Sometimes, one might want to take advantage of specific features like _Apache Kafka's_ `Consumer Group`. This might help to process messages one-at-the-time.

Setting up this is also pretty straight foward using the default `mux/router` by setting the `Group` attribute.

By default, Quark uses `Partition Consumer` when using Apache Kafka.

```go
b.Topic("chat.1").Group("awesome-group").HandleFunc(func(w quark.EventWriter, e *quark.Event) bool {
  log.Print(e.Topic, e.RawValue)
  // publish messages to given topics
  _, _ = w.Write(e.Context, e.RawValue, "chat.2", "chat.3")
  return true
})
```

There are times where we want to fan-in messages into a single processor/`Consumer`, this can be done using Quark too.

The following example demostrates how to do this using just the `mux/router` and the `Topics` function.

_When fan-in is configured, the `Consumer` must be inside a `Group`_

```go
b.Topics("chat.0", "chat.1").Group("chat-group").HandleFunc(func(w quark.EventWriter, e *quark.Event) bool {
  log.Print(e.Topic, e.RawValue)
  // publish messages to given topics
  _, _ = w.Write(e.Context, e.RawValue, "chat.2", "chat.3")
  return true
})
```

Sometimes it might be useful to listen to topics/queues from another system and push them to our specific infrastructure.

Quark lets users to publish to different providers and this is how you can do that.

In addition, the `AWSPublisher` is just an struct implementing `Publisher` interface.
Also, the use of `Group` here is crucial since `Partition Consumer` would publish the message multiple times since every `Consumer` worker is reading from our infrastructure in parallel.

```go
type AWSPublisher struct{}

func (a AWSPublisher) Publish(ctx context.Context, msgs ...*quark.Message) error {
	for _, msg := range msgs {
		log.Printf("publishing - message: %s", msg.Kind)
	}
	return nil
}

// ...

b.Topic("alex.trades").Group("alex.trades").Publisher(AWSPublisher{}).
  HandleFunc(func(w quark.EventWriter, e *quark.Event) bool {
    _, _ = w.Write(e.Context, []byte("alex has traded in a new index fund"),
      "aws.alex.trades", "aws.analytics.trades")
    return true
  })
```

To conclude, after setting up all of our consumers, we must start the `Broker` to start all the requested processes.

Dont forget to graceful shutdown as if you were shutting down an `net/http` server.

```go
// graceful shutdown
stop := make(chan os.Signal)
signal.Notify(stop, os.Interrupt)
go func() {
  if err = b.ListenAndServe(); err != nil && err != quark.ErrBrokerClosed {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
}()

<-stop

log.Printf("stopping %d nodes and %d workers", b.RunningNodes(), b.RunningWorkers())
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Second*10)
defer cancel()

if err = b.Shutdown(ctx); err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}

log.Print(b.RunningNodes(), b.RunningWorkers()) // should be 0,0
```

See the [documentation][doc], [examples][examples] and [FAQ](FAQ.md) for more details.

## Performance

For applications that log in the hot path, reflection-based serialization and
string formatting are prohibitively expensive &mdash; they're CPU-intensive
and make many small allocations. Put differently, using `encoding/json` and
`fmt.Fprintf` to log tons of `interface{}`s makes your application slow.

Quark takes a different approach. It includes a reflection-free, zero-allocation
JSON encoder, and the base `Logger` strives to avoid serialization overhead
and allocations wherever possible. By building the high-level `SugaredLogger`
on that foundation, zap lets users *choose* when they need to count every
allocation and when they'd prefer a more familiar, loosely typed API.

As measured by its own [benchmarking suite][], not only is zap more performant
than comparable structured logging packages &mdash; it's also faster than the
standard library. Like all benchmarks, take these with a grain of salt.<sup
