# :zap: Quark [![GoDoc][doc-img]][doc] [![Build Status][ci-img]][ci] [![Coverage Status][cov-img]][cov] [![Go Version][go-img]][go]
Reliable Event-Driven mechanisms for reactive ecosystems written in Go.

Based on reliable mechanisms from companies such as [Uber](https://eng.uber.com/reliable-reprocessing/) who serve 1M+ requests per-hour, 
Quark offers a fine-tuned set of tools to ease overall complexity.

In Addition, `Quark` _fans-out processes per-consumer to_ **parallelize blocking I/O** _tasks_ (as consuming from a queue/topic would be) and isolate them. Thread-safe and graceful shutdown are a very important part of Quark.

Furthermore, `Quark` stores specific data _(e.g. event id, correlation id, span context, etc)_ into messages headers in binary format to ease disk consumption on the infrastructure and it lets users use their own encoding preferred library. _(JSON, Apache Avro, etc.)_

Therefore, `Quark` lets developers take advantage of those mechanisms with its default configuration and a `gorilla/mux`-like router/mux to keep them in ease and get befenits without complex configurations and handling. You can either choose use _global configurations_ specified in the broker or use an _specific configuration_ for an specific consumer.

_We currently offer Apache Kafka and AWS SNS/SQS implementations, yet we will be adding more implementations such as RabbitMQ and NATS in a near future._

## Installation

`go get github.com/neutrinocorp/quark`

Note that quark only supports the two most recent minor versions of Go.

## Quick Start

Before we set up our consumers, we must define our `Broker` and its required configuration to work as desired.

The following example demostrates how to set up an _Apache Kafka_ `Broker` with an error handler (hook).

_When using Apache Kafka, `Shopify/sarama` package is required as we rely on its mechanisms._

```go
// Create broker
b := quark.NewKafkaBroker(newSaramaCfg(), "localhost:9092")

b.ErrorHandler = func(ctx context.Context, err error) {
  log.Print(err)
}
```

Quark is very straight foward as is based on the `net/http` and `gorilla/mux` packages.
This example demostrates how to listen to an asynchronous topic using the `Topic` function.

If no pool-size was specified, `Quark` will set up to 5 `workers` per-consumer node.

```go
b.Topic("chat.1").HandleFunc(func(w quark.EventWriter, e *quark.Event) bool {
  log.Print(e.Topic, e.RawValue)
  // publish messages to given topics
  _, _ = w.Write(e.Context, e.RawValue, "chat.2", "chat.3") // returns how many messages were published
  return true // this indicates if the consumer should mark the message or not (Ack or NAck)
})
```

Quark parallelize consumers tasks into a pool of `workers` using goroutines and executes graceful shutdown by default. 

The pool size can be defined by the user with a `PoolSize` attribute.

```go
b.Topic("chat.1").PoolSize(10).HandleFunc(func(w quark.EventWriter, e *quark.Event) bool {
  log.Print(e.Topic, e.RawValue)
  // publish messages to given topics
  _, _ = w.Write(e.Context, e.RawValue, "chat.2", "chat.3")
  return true
})
```

Quark is based on _reliable mechanisms_. To make use of them, one needs to specify on either the `Broker` or on an specific topic.

This method relies on `defaultEventWriter` as it contains preconfigured reliable mechanisms to avoid message loops and more functionalities.

```go
b.Topic("chat.1").MaxRetries(3).RetryBackoff(time.Second*3).HandleFunc(func(w quark.EventWriter, e *quark.Event) bool {
  log.Print(e.Topic, e.RawValue)
  // publish messages to given topics
  _, _ = w.Write(e.Context, e.RawValue, "chat.2", "chat.3")
  return true
})
```

To conclude, after setting up all of our consumers, we must start the `Broker` up to trigger and rise all the specified `Consumer`.

Dont forget to graceful shutdown as if you were shutting down an `net/http` server.

```go
// graceful shutdown
stop := make(chan os.Signal)
signal.Notify(stop, os.Interrupt)
go func() {
  if err = b.ListenAndServe(); err != nil && err != quark.ErrBrokerClosed {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
}()

<-stop

log.Printf("stopping %d nodes and %d workers", b.RunningNodes(), b.RunningWorkers())
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Second*10)
defer cancel()

if err = b.Shutdown(ctx); err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}

log.Print(b.RunningNodes(), b.RunningWorkers()) // should be 0,0
```

### Advanced techniques

**Grouping consumer nodes**

One might want to take advantage of specific features like _Apache Kafka's_ `Consumer Group` as this might help to process messages one-at-the-time.

Setting up this is also pretty straight foward using the default `mux/router` by setting the `Group` attribute.

By default, Quark uses `Partition Consumer` when using Apache Kafka.

```go
b.Topic("chat.1").Group("awesome-group").HandleFunc(func(w quark.EventWriter, e *quark.Event) bool {
  log.Print(e.Topic, e.RawValue)
  // publish messages to given topics
  _, _ = w.Write(e.Context, e.RawValue, "chat.2", "chat.3")
  return true
})
```

**Fanning-out messages/queues into a single consumer**

The following example demostrates how to do the current case using the `mux` and the `Topics` function.

_When fan-in is configured, the `Consumer` must be inside a `Group`_

```go
b.Topics("chat.0", "chat.1").Group("chat-group").HandleFunc(func(w quark.EventWriter, e *quark.Event) bool {
  log.Print(e.Topic, e.RawValue)
  // publish messages to given topics
  _, _ = w.Write(e.Context, e.RawValue, "chat.2", "chat.3")
  return true
})
```

**Custom publisher per-consumer**

Sometimes it might be useful to listen to topics/queues from another provider and push them to one specific provider.

Say you were listening topics from Kafka but you want to publish the output into AWS SNS.

The following example demostrates how to tackle the previous scenario with Quark.

In addition, the `AWSPublisher` is just an struct implementing `Publisher` interface.

Therefore, the use of `Group` is crucial here since `Partition Consumer` is treated as single unit of processing and it would publish the message N-times (the pool size since `Consumer` workers are running in parallel).

```go
type AWSPublisher struct{}

func (a AWSPublisher) Publish(ctx context.Context, msgs ...*quark.Message) error {
	for _, msg := range msgs {
		log.Printf("publishing - message: %s", msg.Kind)
	}
	return nil
}

// ...

b.Topic("alex.trades").Group("alex.trades").Publisher(AWSPublisher{}).
  HandleFunc(func(w quark.EventWriter, e *quark.Event) bool {
    _, _ = w.Write(e.Context, []byte("alex has traded in a new index fund"),
      "aws.alex.trades", "aws.analytics.trades")
    return true
  })
```

## Performance

For applications that log in the hot path, reflection-based serialization and
string formatting are prohibitively expensive &mdash; they're CPU-intensive
and make many small allocations. Put differently, using `encoding/json` and
`fmt.Fprintf` to log tons of `interface{}`s makes your application slow.

Quark takes a different approach. It includes a reflection-free, zero-allocation
JSON encoder, and the base `Logger` strives to avoid serialization overhead
and allocations wherever possible. By building the high-level `SugaredLogger`
on that foundation, zap lets users *choose* when they need to count every
allocation and when they'd prefer a more familiar, loosely typed API.

As measured by its own [benchmarking suite][], not only is zap more performant
than comparable structured logging packages &mdash; it's also faster than the
standard library. Like all benchmarks, take these with a grain of salt.<sup
