A Reliable Router for Event-Driven ecosystems written in Go.

Based on reliable mechanisms from companies such as [Uber](https://eng.uber.com/reliable-reprocessing/), 
Quark offers an Event Router with a fine-tuned set of tools to ease overall complexity when distributed message processing is required.

Thread-safe processing, parallelism, concurrency and graceful shutdowns are elemental components of `Quark`.

More in deep, `Quark` _fans-out processes per-consumer to_ **parallelize blocking I/O** _tasks_ (as consuming from a queue/topic would be).

Furthermore, `Quark` uses the _[Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/)_ specification to compose messages. `Quark` lets developers use their preferred encoding format _(JSON, Apache Avro, etc.)_ and sets message headers as binary data when possible to reduce computational costs.

Aside basic functionalities, it is worth to mention `Quark` is **_fully customizable_** at any level _(Broker or Consumer)_, so any developer may get the maximum potential out of `Quark`. 

A simple set of examples would be:
- Override the default Event Writer to apply custom resilience mechanisms.
- Increasing a Worker pool size for an specific Consumer process.
- Override the default Publisher (e.g. Apache Kafka) for another provider Publisher (e.g. AWS SNS).

To conclude, `Quark` exposes a friendly API based on Go's idiomatic best practices and the `net/http` + popular HTTP mux (`gorilla/mux`, `gin-gonic/gin`, `labstack/echo`) packages to increase overall usability and productivity.

_* to be implemented_

## Installation

Since `Quark` uses Go submodules to decompose specific depenencies for providers, it is required to install concrete implementations _(Apache Kafka, In memory, Redis, ...)_ manually. One may install these using the following command.

_One may use this single command, `Quark` core_

`go get github.com/neutrinocorp/quark/bus/YOUR_PROVIDER`

If one wants to develop its own custom implementations, it is required to install `Quark` core library. It can be done running the following command.

`go get github.com/neutrinocorp/quark`

_Note that `Quark` only supports the two most recent minor versions of Go._

## Quick Start

Before we set up our consumers, we must define our `Broker` and its required configuration to work as desired.

The following example demonstrates how to set up an _Apache Kafka_ `Broker` with an error handler (hook).

_When using Apache Kafka, `Shopify/sarama` package is required as we rely on its mechanisms._

```go
// Create broker
b := quark.NewKafkaBroker(newSaramaCfg(), "localhost:9092")

b.ErrorHandler = func(ctx context.Context, err error) {
  log.Print(err)
}
```

Quark is very straight forward as is based on the `net/http` and `gorilla/mux` packages.
This example demonstrates how to listen to an asynchronous topic using the `Topic` function.

If no pool-size was specified, `Quark` will set up to 5 `workers` per-consumer node.

```go
b.Topic("chat.1").HandleFunc(func(w quark.EventWriter, e *quark.Event) bool {
  log.Print(e.Topic, e.RawValue)
  // publish messages to given topics
  _, _ = w.Write(e.Context, e.RawValue, "chat.2", "chat.3") // returns how many messages were published
  return true // this indicates if the consumer should mark the message or not (Ack or NAck)
})
```

Quark parallelize consumers tasks into a pool of `workers` using goroutines and executes a graceful shutdown by default. 

The pool size can be defined by the user with a `PoolSize` attribute.

```go
b.Topic("chat.1").PoolSize(10).HandleFunc(func(w quark.EventWriter, e *quark.Event) bool {
  log.Print(e.Topic, e.RawValue)
  // publish messages to given topics
  _, _ = w.Write(e.Context, e.RawValue, "chat.2", "chat.3")
  return true
})
```

Quark is based on _reliable mechanisms_. To make use of them, one needs to specify on either the `Broker` or on a specific topic.

This method relies on `defaultEventWriter` as it contains preconfigured reliable mechanisms to avoid message loops and more functionalities.

```go
b.Topic("cosmos.payments").MaxRetries(3).RetryBackoff(time.Second*3).HandleFunc(func(w quark.EventWriter, e *quark.Event) bool {
  // ... something failed in our processing
  if e.Body.Metadata.RedeliveryCount > 3 {
  	// executed if our message has been processed too much, send to Dead Letter Queue
  	w.Header().Set(quark.HeaderMessageRedeliveryCount, 0)
  	_, _ = w.Write(e.Context, e.RawValue, "dlq.cosmos.payment")
	return true
  }
  
  // publish messages to retry queue, message loop will be avoided by defaultEventWriter
  e.Body.Metadata.RedeliveryCount++
  w.Header().Set(quark.HeaderMessageRedeliveryCount, strconv.Itoa(e.Body.Metadata.RedeliveryCount))
  _, _ = w.Write(e.Context, e.RawValue, "retry.cosmos.payment")
  return true
})
```

To conclude, after setting up all of our consumers, we must start the `Broker` up to trigger and rise all the specified `Consumer`.

Don't forget to graceful shutdown as if you were shutting down a `net/http` server.

```go
// graceful shutdown
stop := make(chan os.Signal)
signal.Notify(stop, os.Interrupt)
go func() {
  if err = b.ListenAndServe(); err != nil && err != quark.ErrBrokerClosed {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
}()

<-stop

log.Printf("stopping %d nodes and %d workers", b.RunningNodes(), b.RunningWorkers())
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Second*10)
defer cancel()

if err = b.Shutdown(ctx); err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}

log.Print(b.RunningNodes(), b.RunningWorkers()) // should be 0,0
```

### Advanced techniques

**Grouping consumer nodes**

One might want to take advantage of specific features like _Apache Kafka's_ `Consumer Group` as this might help to process messages one-at-the-time.

This can be done using the default `mux` by setting the `Group` attribute.

By default, Quark uses `Partition Consumer` when using Apache Kafka.

```go
b.Topic("chat.1").Group("awesome-group").HandleFunc(func(w quark.EventWriter, e *quark.Event) bool {
  log.Print(e.Topic, e.RawValue)
  // publish messages to given topics
  _, _ = w.Write(e.Context, e.RawValue, "chat.2", "chat.3")
  return true
})
```

**Fanning-in messages/queues into a single consumer**

The following example demonstrates how to do the current case using the `mux` and the `Topics` function.

_When fan-in is configured, the `Consumer` must be inside a `Group`_

```go
b.Topics("chat.0", "chat.1").Group("chat-group").HandleFunc(func(w quark.EventWriter, e *quark.Event) bool {
  log.Print(e.Topic, e.RawValue)
  // publish messages to given topics
  _, _ = w.Write(e.Context, e.RawValue, "chat.2", "chat.3")
  return true
})
```

**Custom publisher per-consumer**

Say you were listening topics from Kafka, yet you want to publish the output into AWS SNS instead Kafka (specified in the global configuration).

The following example demonstrates how to tackle the previous scenario with Quark.

Therefore, the use of `Group` is crucial here since `Partition Consumer` is treated as single unit of processing, and it would publish the message N-times (the pool size since `Consumer` workers are running in parallel).

```go
type AWSPublisher struct{}

func (a AWSPublisher) Publish(ctx context.Context, msgs ...*quark.Message) error {
	for _, msg := range msgs {
		log.Printf("publishing - message: %s", msg.Kind)
	}
	return nil
}

// ...

b.Topic("alex.trades").Group("alex.trades").Publisher(AWSPublisher{}).
  HandleFunc(func(w quark.EventWriter, e *quark.Event) bool {
    _, _ = w.Write(e.Context, []byte("alex has traded in a new index fund"),
      "aws.alex.trades", "aws.analytics.trades")
    return true
  })
```
